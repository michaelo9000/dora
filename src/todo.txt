definite
- record word uses and promote underused words
    - how should this work???
    - idk first version it ignores most used words and picks from words used less than the most
- weight more common words to appear more often
- auto-hide history items older than the last
- rules page

probably
- prompt a certain tense to be used

nicety
- check that each prompted word has been utilised
- autocomplete for words
