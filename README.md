#  Dora
A language learning app in which you enter your vocabulary and are asked to speak sentences using three random words at a time.  
Uses speech-to-text to record your sentence and present it to you.

Uses Google translate to give the english version of your sentence, and the spanish translation of the english translation to suggest how it might be said more correctly or typically.

By default, gives one verb, one noun and one adjective per round, but has a wildcard option in which word type is disregarded.

Allows retrying sentences if mistakes are made or the speech-to-text didn't capture your sentence properly.

Records the times you have used each word and prioritises less used words.
